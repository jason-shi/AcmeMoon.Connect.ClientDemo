- Ensure your Unity project's .NET version is set to 4.x in player settings.
- Unity does not support nuget nicely, so you must clone and compile IdentityModel.OidcClient2 solution using Visual Studio 2017.
- Copy Assets/IdentityModel from sample to your Unity project's Assets folder.
- Import Json.Net.Unity3D package available from https://github.com/SaladLab/Json.Net.Unity3D.
- You must then move Newtonsoft.Json.dll from Assets/UnityPackages/JsonNet/ to the same location as your OidcClient binaries.
- Add link.xml(https://github.com/SaladLab/Json.Net.Unity3D/blob/master/src/UnityPackage/Assets/link.xml), it used by Newtonsoft.Json.dll
- Add mcs.rsp files to your Assets folderï¼Œinput "-r:System.Net.Http.dll" to it, it'll use the reference system.Net.Http.dll in .Net4.x
- Make sure your sign-in scene has a GameObject called SignInCanvas that has a script attached with function OnAuthReply, as demonstrated in the example scene in this repo. The OnAuthReply function will receive the login callback from browser.
